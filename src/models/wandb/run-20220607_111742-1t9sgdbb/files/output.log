/home/xps/anaconda3/envs/deeplearning/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torchmetrics/utilities/prints.py:36: UserWarning: Torchmetrics v0.9 introduced a new argument class property called `full_state_update` that has
                not been set for this class (_ResultMetric). The property determines if `update` by
                default needs access to the full metric state. If this is not the case, significant speedups can be
                achieved and we recommend setting this to `False`.
                We provide an checking function
                `from torchmetrics.utilities import check_forward_no_full_state`
                that can be used to check if the `full_state_update=True` (old and potential slower behaviour,
                default for now) or if `full_state_update=False` can be used safely.
